# Hardware-Communication-Using-MISRA-C-Guideline
Hardware communication using the MODBUS UDP protocol ensures reliable, real-time data exchange between controllers and devices over Ethernet. Implemented in MISRA C for safety-critical systems, it enforces robust coding standards, minimizing errors and enhancing portability, maintainability, and deterministic performance.
